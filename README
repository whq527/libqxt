解压源码，不包含中文路径，尽量在顶层目录。
修改configre.bat 将qmake的路径添加到环境变量, 根据32位64位修改
在开始菜单里运行”VS2015开发人员命令提示“出configre.bat -msvc
然后运行命令：configure -msvc
在“qxtmailattachment.h"添加头文件: #include<QIODevice>
将项目中的所有“QT_STATIC_CONST_IMPL”换成“const"
将项目中的所有“QT_STATIC_CONST”换成“static const"

1) configure

	make sure qmake is in your PATH and run ./configure  or configure.bat on windows.

    	see configure --help for more information

    	(for msvc you could try  ./configure.bat -msvc and open 
    		the solution file in msvc, we recomend compiling on
    		commandline though)

2) build
	
	type make or nmake when using msvc
	then don't forget to make install 
	Note: This will also install qxt.prf to your qtdir/mkspecs/features directory.



3) use

	Add the following lines to your qmake project file:
	CONFIG  += qxt
	QXT     += core gui

	The QXT variable should contain the modules you want. (In this example core and gui are used.)
	Note: Some modules depend on other modules. The required modules are added automatically.

	if you have an existing msvc project and can't swtich to qmake you can use zbenjamins solution:
	
	     Howto use libqxt in a existing Visual Studio Project:
	      1.  create and install libqxt. (See install instructions)
	      2.  add {libqxtinstalldir}\include\qxt\QxtCore to your include path
	      3.  add {libqxtinstalldir}\lib to your library search path
	      4.  to add a specific libqxt module (f.e QxtSql) you have to:
	           - add {libqxtinstalldir}\include\qxt\QxtSql to your include path
	           - add the library QxtSql.lib to your project
	          Most of the times you have also to include the QxtCore and QxtKit modules.
	          It's done the same way like the example above.

Building packages (Linux/Unix - experimental):

To build packages for Redhat or Debian based distributions, you can utilize
the "rpm" or "deb" make targets. Perform the configure as outlined above,
edit the "config" file in the packages subdirectory if needed and then type
"make rpm" or "make deb" as appropriate. This will also perform a "make clean"
to avoid copying files which will be rebuilt anyway.

For RPM packages, you will need a standard .rpmmacros file in your home
directory. A sample file, "rpmmacros-sample", is contained in the packages
directory and must be edited for your environment before use.
